### Tasks üìö
__0. Squared simple__
- Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
	- Prototype: ``def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):``
	- ``matrix`` is a 2 dimensional array
	- Returns a new matrix:
		- Same size as ``matrix``
		- Each value should be the square of the value of the input
	- Initial matrix should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You are allowed to use regular loops, ``map``, etc.

__1. Search and replace__
- Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list
	- Prototype: ``def search_replace(my_list, search, replace):``
	- ``my_list`` is the initial list
	- ``search`` is the element to replace in the list
	- ``replace`` is the new element
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__2. Unique addition__
- Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer)
	
	- Prototype: ``def uniq_add(my_list=[]):``
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__3. Present in both__
- Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
	- Prototype: ``def common_elements(set_1, set_2):``
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__4. Only differents__
- Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
	- Prototype: ``def only_diff_elements(set_1, set_2):``
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__5. Number of keys__
- Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
	- Prototype: ``def number_keys(a_dictionary):``
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	 
__6. Print sorted dictionary__
- Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
	- Prototype: ``def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):``
	- You can assume that all keys are strings
	- Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
	- Only sort keys of the first level (don‚Äôt sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
	- Dictionary values can have any type
	- You are not allowed to import any module	  

__7. Update dictionary__
- Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
	- Prototype: ``def update_dictionary(a_dictionary, key, value):``
	- ``key`` argument will be always a string
	- ``value`` argument will be any type
	- If a key exists in the dictionary, the value will be replaced
	- If a key doesn‚Äôt exist in the dictionary, it will be created
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__8. Simple delete by key__
- Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
	- Prototype: ``def simple_delete(a_dictionary, key=""):``
	- ``key`` argument will be always a string
	- If a key doesn‚Äôt exist, the dictionary won‚Äôt change
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__9. Multiply by 2__
- Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
	- Prototype: def multiply_by_2(a_dictionary):
	- You can assume that all values are only integers
	- Returns a new dictionary
	- You are not allowed to import any module

10. Best score
- Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
	- Prototype: ``def best_score(a_dictionary):``
	- You can assume that all values are only integers
	- If no score found, return ``None``
	- You can assume all students have a different score
	- You are not allowed to import any module

__11. Multiply by using map__
- Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
	- Prototype: ``def multiply_list_map(my_list=[], number=0):``
	- Returns a new list:
	    - Same length as ``my_list``
i	    - Each value should be multiplied by ``number``
	- Initial list should not be modified
	- You are not allowed to import any module
	- You have to use ``map``
	- Your file should be max 3 lines

__12. Roman to Integer__
__Technical interview preparation:__
	- You are not allowed to google anything
	- Whiteboard first
Create a function ``def roman_to_int(roman_string):`` that converts a ``Roman numeral`` to an integer.
	- You can assume the number will be between 1 to 3999.
	- ``def roman_to_int(roman_string)`` must return an integer
	- If the ``roman_string`` is not a string or ``None``, return
