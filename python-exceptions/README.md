### Tasks 📚

__1. Safe printing of an integers list__

- Write a function that prints an integer with ``"{:d}".format()``

Prototype: def ``safe_print_integer(value):``
``value`` can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
The integer should be printed followed by a new line
Returns ``True`` if ``value`` has been correctly printed (it means the ``value`` is an integer)
Otherwise, returns ``False``
You have to use ``try: / except:``
You have to use ``"{:d}".format()`` to print as integer
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use ``type()``
